# **Decentralized Vault: Own Your Secrets, Forever**

### A private vault powered by **Stellar + IPFS**, designed for privacy, transparency, and full user control.

---

### 🔐 Why This Vault?

Tired of centralized password managers and cloud vaults? Our **decentralized vault** puts *you* in control — no middlemen, no leaks, no surveillance.

* **End-to-End Encrypted:** Your data is encrypted **before** it leaves your device.
* **Stored on IPFS:** No centralized server. Your vault lives on a decentralized network.
* **Anchored to Stellar:** Every vault update is immutably logged via blockchain — fast and cheap.
* **Flexible Login:** Use a master password or private key. Your vault, your rules.
* **Verifiable History:** Each entry is cryptographically signed and validated using **Tracecore**, our custom commit engine.

---

### ⚡ What You Can Store

Easily store and organize sensitive information with modular, dynamic forms:

* ✅ **Passwords & Login Credentials**
* ✅ **Credit Card Details**
* ✅ **Identity Documents**
* ✅ Private Notes or SSH/PGP Keys
* ⏳ Custom Record Types via Extensible Card System

---

### 🧩 Dynamic & Extensible UI

* Add new entry types with zero hardcoded logic.
* React frontend automatically loads the correct form based on entry type.
* Schema-driven, modular design — ready for scaling and user-generated templates.


---

### 🌍 Why It Matters

Unlike traditional vaults, ours is:

* **Zero-trust:** Not even we can see your data.
* **Censorship-resistant:** There’s no central kill switch.
* **Session-Secured:** Vault stays in memory until committed.
* **Open-source:** Auditable and transparent.

---

### 🚀 What’s Live Now?

* 🔐 Local vault session with multiple entry types
* 📦 Entry creation with **Tracecore validation + Stellar anchoring**
* 🧾 Automatic commit signature and envelope generation
* 🧠 Session persistence with synced, structured state

---

# **Project Summary: A Self-Sovereign Vault Platform Using Stellar, IPFS & Tracecore**

---

### 🔍 Vision

We’re building a **decentralized digital vault** that reimagines how sensitive information is stored, accessed, and verified — using **IPFS** for storage, **Stellar** for anchoring, and **Tracecore** for commit validation and traceability. A **self-sovereign, zero-trust infrastructure** for the privacy-first web.

---

### 🔐 Core Innovation

**Client-Side Encryption + IPFS + Tracecore Validation + Blockchain Anchoring = Verifiable, Private, Distributed Vault**

* **Data Integrity:** Immutable logs via **Stellar** + signed Tracecore commits
* **Redundancy & Resilience:** Decentralized storage through **IPFS**
* **Zero-Knowledge:** Vault content is never exposed to our servers or the chain
* **Actor Signatures:** All entries are verifiably signed by user identity
* **Rule-Based Validation:** Commit enforcement using `REQUIRES_SIGNATURE`, `VALID_ACTORS_ONLY`, etc.

---

### 🧱 Technical Architecture

* **Tracecore Commit System:** Lightweight DVCS-style engine for immutable history
* **Session Vaults:** All state stays in local memory until explicitly committed
* **Entry Registry Pattern:** Auto-binding of handlers for new types (e.g., login, card, identity)
* **Dynamic React Forms:** Rendered via schema without hardcoding

---

### 🧱 Smart Architecture

* **Entry Registry Pattern:** Automatically registers new entry types with zero switch-case logic.
* **Dynamic UI Binding:** React-based frontend loads correct form for any entry type.
* **Session-Based Local Vaults:** All user operations happen in local memory until persisted.

---

### 💸 Business Model

**Freemium-first → Dev & Enterprise Tooling**

* **Free Tier:** Local vault + manual IPFS publishing
* **Pro Plan:** Auto IPFS sync, Stellar commit fee coverage, multi-device restore
* **Enterprise:** Secure compliance vaults, hosted IPFS gateways, audit trails, and delegated signing

**Coming Monetization Channels:**

* **Tokenized Participation:** For anchoring, hosting, or indexing
* **Vault-as-a-Service SDK:** Easily embed secure storage in fintech/health/legal products


---

### 📈 Market Opportunity

We are at the intersection of:

* 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Systems**
* 🪪 **Decentralized Identity**
* ☁️ **User-Owned Cloud**

As users demand **ownership, auditability, and privacy**, we’re delivering the **platform layer** to support the next generation of apps requiring secure, verifiable personal data storage.


---

### 🧱 MVP Roadmap

## 💼 Add-On Services You Can Offer to Enterprises

* **On-premise deployment & onboarding**
* **Compliance consulting (GDPR/HIPAA audits)**
* **Dedicated IPFS node hosting**
* **Custom blockchain anchoring strategies (multi-chain support)**
* **Disaster recovery assistance**

---

Would you like me to help draft a **Corporate Product Brochure**, a **pitch deck for public sector procurement**, or design an **enterprise landing page** that speaks to these audiences?




That’s a strong and clear direction — you’re thinking like a product strategist and platform architect. Using **Keycloak** for federated identity is a great choice (fully open-source, battle-tested, supports all major IdPs, SSO/OIDC/SAML, and fine-grained policies).

And your business approach is sound:

* **Store data on the client by default** → privacy, sovereignty
* **Offer managed storage & compliance** for enterprise use → business model
* **Use individuals to validate UX and security story**, but **monetize via B2B/B2G**

Let’s now shape this into a **12-month roadmap** for your **Decentralized Vault Platform**, with a strong focus on enterprise readiness.
